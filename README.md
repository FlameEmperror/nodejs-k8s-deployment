# Node.js Application with CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for a simple Node.js application. The pipeline is designed to automate processes including testing, containerization, deployment, and notifications, using modern tools and best practices.

## Approach

### 1. **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to create an automated pipeline that ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for a Node.js application. This pipeline leverages GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, and Slack for notifications.

### 2. **Key Features**
- **Automated Testing**: Every pull request triggers a series of tests to validate the application's code quality.
- **Dockerization**: The application is containerized using Docker, enabling consistent environments from development to production.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: The pipeline deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster, using declarative YAML manifests.
- **Slack Notifications**: Deployment status updates are sent to a Slack channel to inform the team of success or failure.

### 3. **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Notification Service**: Slack (via Incoming Webhooks)

### 4. **Workflow Overview**
The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file and is triggered on pull requests and pushes to the main branch. Key stages of the workflow include:

1. **Checkout Code**: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
2. **Run Tests**: Executes unit tests located in the `test/` directory.
3. **Build Docker Image**: Creates a Docker image and tags it appropriately.
4. **Push Docker Image**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub using credentials stored as GitHub Secrets.
5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Uses `kubectl` to deploy the application to the cluster using configuration files in the `k8s/` directory.
6. **Send Slack Notification**: Sends a message to Slack indicating the success or failure of the deployment.

### 5. **Setup and Configuration**
1. **Local Testing**:
   - Install dependencies with `npm install`.
   - Run tests using `npm test`.

2. **Docker Build**:
   - Build the Docker image locally with `docker build -t my-app .`.

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - Ensure `kubectl` is configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests using `kubectl apply -f k8s/`.

### 7. **Conclusion**
This CI/CD pipeline ensures that the Node.js application is tested, containerized, deployed, and monitored efficiently. It streamlines the development process, reducing manual steps and the risk of human error, while maintaining high code quality and system reliability.
